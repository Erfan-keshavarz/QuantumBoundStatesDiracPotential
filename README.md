# One-dimensional quantum bound states from multiple Dirac-delta potentials
This project introduces a Python program designed to simulate a one-dimensional quantum system with an array of multiple Dirac delta potentials. The primary objective of the code is to find bound states and eigenenergies within this setup. 
## Simulation 

Simmulation covers 2 main aspects: 

1. **bound states and eigenenergies**: We are able to obtain numerical solutions for the bound states and eigenenergies.

2. **impurities**: We are capable of investigating the behavior of quantum particles in the presence of impurities.



## Usage 
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository has a comprehensive simulation, including scientific computations using both numerical and analytical approaches, as well as additional visualizations. You may either run the notebook locally to repeat the simulation or adapt it to meet your own requirements.

## Dependencies 

The project utilized the following libraries:

- numpy
- sympy
- matplotlib
- scipy

## Procedures for utilizing the code 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the `QuantumBoundStatesDiracPotential.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any other IDEs.
4. Run the code sequentially to perform simmulation.
